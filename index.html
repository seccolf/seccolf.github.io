          <h2>About me</h2>
          <p> I'm currently a PhD Candidate at the University of Pennsylvania, expecting to graduate by Summer 2020. I hold a Master's degree in Physics from Universidade de SÃ£o Paulo (2015) and a Bachelor's degree in Physics from Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul (2013). You can check out my complete CV here: LINK.</p>
          <p> I'm originally from Brazil and care about how science (and scientists) can contribute to social progress by fueling a culture of humanism, skepticism and intellectual honesty. In practice, I try to achieve that by blogging (link to Medium) and tweeting (link to twitter) about science and politics. </p>

	<h2>About my work</h2>
	<p>My main research ideas are focused on Cosmology and Astrophysics. Pushing the boundaries of this field is likely our best chance to answer some of the most puzzling questions of modern natural science: What is the Universe made of? What is Dark Matter? Why is the expansion of the Universe accelerating?</p>
	<p>As a member of the Dark Energy Survey (DES), I have been working for years on state-of-the-art Observational Cosmology with data sets of unprecedented statistical power. I have contributed directly to several different analyzes aimed at constraining the fundamental parameters of the Universe, specially those which employ the tools of Gravitational Lensing, a consequence of Einstein's Relativity. </p>
	<p>I'm also interested the statistics of the Large Scale Structure of the Universe as well as the nature of Dark Matter, using a mix of computational techniques and observational data. Click below to see a list of my scientific publications related to the topics above. </p>
